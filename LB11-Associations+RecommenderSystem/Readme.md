**Association Rules** are simple If/Then statements that help discover relationships between seemingly independent items in relational databases or other data repositories. Most machine learning algorithms work with numeric datasets and hence tend to be mathematical. However, **Association Rule Mining** is suitable for non-numeric, categorical data and requires just a little bit more than simple counting. 

Association Rule Mining is a procedure which aims to *observe frequently occurring patterns*, correlations, or associations from datasets found in various kinds of databases such as relational databases, transactional databases, and other forms of repositories.

## B) Recommender Systems

In a very general way, **Recommender Systems** are algorithms aimed at suggesting relevant items to users (items being movies to watch, text to read, products to buy or anything else depending on industries). Recommender Systems are really critical in some industries as they can generate a huge amount of income when they are efficient or also be a way to stand out significantly from competitors.  
As a proof of the importance of recommender systems, we can mention that, a few years ago, Netflix organised a challenges (the “Netflix prize”) where the goal was to produce a recommender system that performs better than its own algorithm with a prize of 1 million dollars to win.
